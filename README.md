# ðŸŽ“ Student Information System (SIS) â€” C++ OOP Prototype

A simple **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** prototype built in **C++** for managing basic student information.  
This project demonstrates key OOP principles such as **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, **constructors**, **destructors**, and **constructor overloading**.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

You have recently joined **TechVision Pvt. Ltd.** as a Junior Software Developer.  
Your task: build a small prototype of a **Student Information System (SIS)** that can store and manage basic student records.

The system represents real-world entities (students) as C++ classes and objects, showing how OOP helps organize data efficiently.

## ðŸš€ Features

âœ… **Encapsulation** â€” Data members (`name`, `age`, `rollNo`, `gpa`) are private; access controlled through getters and setters.  
âœ… **Abstraction** â€” Methods like `displayGrade()` hide internal GPA-to-grade logic.  
âœ… **Constructors** â€” Both default and parameterized constructors demonstrate object initialization flexibility.  
âœ… **Destructor** â€” Displays a message when an object is destroyed, showing object lifecycle.  
âœ… **Constructor Overloading** â€” Multiple constructors with different parameters.  
âœ… **Clear, Simple, and Modular** â€” Code split across `.h`, `.cpp`, and `main.cpp` files.
